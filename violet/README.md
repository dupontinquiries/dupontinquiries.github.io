# Violet

Violet makes passwords a breeze.  Please visit the [help page](https://dupontinquiries.github.io/violet/help.html) for more information!

## TODO

- [ ] sounds ([guidelines](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6529645/how-to-add-background-music-to-a-web-page))
  - [ ] add landing page sound effect that is unobtrusive
  - [ ] keyfile download and upload sounds (maybe)
  - [ ] make and use load page sounds (maybe)
- [ ] add another box to the upload page that opens up a list of username and password boxes that you can click on to copy (make a full-fledged password manager for items I want to store)
- [ ] add a new page Violet for dedicated password files (still better than keypass because more devices... but need an offline backup that will be able to open when not on wifi)
